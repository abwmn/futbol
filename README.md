# Futbol

## Iteration 1

--We plan to check in every day during work time/evening, and once per weekend.

--We will organize tasks on a shared Trello board: https://trello.com/w/futbol96

  --completed code will be committed to a separate branch and PRs will be reviewed by the others before merging
  
--We were able to agree on the above workflow as the first suggestion

--Coding tasks will be organized according to a to-be-determined theoretical structure and divided as evenly as possible

--Initial DTR: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TVIrKCc77yoqR3RBaRtuyYKPL8ZL5cEUSyujZdC1YwQ/edit?usp=sharing
