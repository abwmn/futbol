# Futbol

## Iteration 1

--We plan to check in every day during work time/evening, and once per weekend.

--We will organize tasks on a shared Trello board: https://trello.com/w/futbol96

  --completed code will be committed to a separate branch and PRs will be reviewed by the others before merging
  
--We were able to agree on the above workflow as the first suggestion

--Coding tasks will be organized according to a to-be-determined theoretical structure and divided as evenly as possible

--Initial DTR: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TVIrKCc77yoqR3RBaRtuyYKPL8ZL5cEUSyujZdC1YwQ/edit?usp=sharing

# Top 3 things we did right:
1. Great job keeping communication lines open and meeting regularly through study hall. Made sure we all knew what was going on.
2. Playing to each others strengths and providing a supportive team environment.
3. Reilly has done an excellent job leading us and keeping us on track and Andrew is amazing with Hashes and we all learned so much from watching him work.

# Top 3 things we would do DIFFERENTLY next time:
1. Coming up with a structure and a plan could have prevented problems down the road.
2. Planning ahead could have made for an easier refactor and allowed an easier way to include modules.
3. Reach out for help more when hitting unproductive struggle.
